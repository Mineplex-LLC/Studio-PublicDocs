# When to use Managed Databases
Managed databases are a powerful way to store and query data for your Studio project. Unlike the built-in Data Storage Module, these are highly flexible and often include a robust open-source driver and ecosystem. However, they also have a separate pricing structure and carry addiitonal operational burden. 

Generally speaking, it is best for new projects or Studio developers to start with the built-in Data Storage Module. However, if you are already familiar with a specific database technology, or have a specific use case that requires a more powerful database, you may want to consider using a managed database.

# Creating a Managed Database
Managed Databases can be created with `yaml` files (simliar to purchase definitions) in your project's `config/databases` directory. These files define the database type, and may in the future also allow for version changes and other configuration options.

## Example `config/databases/my-database.yaml`
```yaml
databaseName: "my-database"
type: "MYSQL" # can be one of MYSQL, POSTGRES, or MONGO
```

If you are using the Mineplex-provided GitHub Publisher action, adding this file to your repository on the default branch will cause a MySQL database named `my-database` to be created. 

# Using a Managed Database
The Mineplex SDK provides built-in functionality for retrieving a database driver client based on its unique name. This client can be used to perform any operations that the database driver supports. For MySQL and Postgres, the SDK provides a `JDBC` client, and for MongoDB, the SDK provides a `MongoClient` client. 

More details on retrieving a managed database client instance will be added soon.
