description: Comprehensive guidelines for safeguarding data.
---

We are committed to ensuring that all user data is protected and secure. To achieve this, studios must take proactive steps to safeguard sensitive or potentially malicious data.

## How We Represent Sensitive Data
Sensitive data that should not be shared with the general public is marked with the `@SensitiveData` annotation on the class, field, argument, or other appropriate location.

### What Does This Mean?
- **No Logging**: Sensitive data must not be logged into the console.
- **No Public Display**: Sensitive data must not be displayed in Minecraft chat for all players to see.
- **Controlled Access**: Access to sensitive data should be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with data protection policies.

Violations of these rules will result in repercussions for your studio, as defined in our Studio End User License Agreement.

## Best Practices for Data Protection
To further ensure data privacy, studios should adhere to the following best practices:

- **Minimize Data Collection**: Only collect data that is necessary for your operations.
- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize data whenever possible to protect user identities.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all systems and software up to date with the latest security patches.
- **Training**: Provide regular training for staff on data protection and privacy best practices.

## Reporting Data Mishandling
It is essential that any violation of our data privacy policies be reported to us immediately, whether by the studio responsible or by a player who notices the issue. Prompt reporting allows us to take corrective action, such as removing sensitive data from logs, and remedy the situation.

### How to Report

- **Discord**: Ping us in the Studio Partner Discord after sending an email if the matter is urgent.

By adhering to these guidelines and promptly reporting any mishandling, you help us maintain a secure environment for everyone.
