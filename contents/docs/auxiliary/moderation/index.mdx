## Player Transparency
Guidelines to ensure clear communication and accessibility of rules for players.
To ensure fair play and maintain trust, the following guidelines must be followed:
- **Clear Communication**: Players must always be informed of the reason for their punishment.
- **Accessibility of Rules**: Your game rules must be published on your Discord server or website and be accessible in-game.
- **Distinct Game Rules**: If you have multiple games with different rules, it must be clearly communicated to players at the start of each game.

## Studio Responsibility
Specific responsibilities of studios in enforcing their game rules.
Studios are responsible for enforcing their specific game rules. Here are some examples (optional to enforce) of rules you might include:
- **No Teaming**: Ensuring that players do not form teams in solo game modes or where teaming is not allowed.
- **No Ghosting**: Preventing players from using outside communication to gain an unfair advantage or providing information to living players after being eliminated.
