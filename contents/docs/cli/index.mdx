The Studio CLI is a command-line interface for Windows, Mac, and Linux that allows you to create and develop content on Mineplex.

While you can interact with our control plane API directly (and may wish to in custom build and deployment environments), the CLI provides a simple, intuitive mechanism for getting started with the Mineplex Studio platform. It wraps helpful functionality for both beginners and advanced users, including project scaffolding, hotswapping development builds, and more.
