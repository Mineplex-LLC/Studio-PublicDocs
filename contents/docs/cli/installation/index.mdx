You may wish to rename the Studio binary file and add it to your path or project directory. In our documentation, we use the `studio` command, which references a version of the binary file that has been added to the system path.

On a Windows system, you can add executables to the system path from the Environment Variables menu in the Control Panel. On a Mac or Linux system, you can add executables to the system path by editing the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file.

Note that there are peer dependencies to the Studio CLI. Specifically, you must have the GitHub CLI installed (as well as Java to fully utilize optional CLI functions). 
To validate your system setup, run the `studio check` command in your terminal.
