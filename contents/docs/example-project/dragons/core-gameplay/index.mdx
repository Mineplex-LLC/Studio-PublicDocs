### Core Gameplay

The core gameplay of our Dragons game revolves around the interaction between players, dragons, and various kits. Players must navigate through the map, avoid dragons, and use their chosen kits to outsmart their opponents. Below is an overview of the key components of the game.

#### **Dragon Spawning and Pathfinding**
Dragons are one of the central threats in the game, and their behavior is key to creating tension. The spawning and pathfinding mechanics control how and where dragons appear, as well as how they move across the map. The dragons are designed to be dynamic and react to different stimuli, such as players' actions and the use of sparkler items (in the case of the Pyrotechnic kit). Proper dragon pathfinding ensures they provide a challenging and engaging experience for players as they navigate the map.

#### **Kit Selector**
Before entering the game, players must choose their kit. The Kit Selector is an essential part of the pregame phase, where players can decide between available kits that offer unique abilities and equipment. The choice of kit can greatly affect gameplay, with each kit providing strategic advantages in different situations.

#### **Kits**
The kits available in the game are designed to change the way players interact with the environment and dragons. For example, the **Pyrotechnic** kit provides players with sparklers to lure dragons away, while the **Coward** kit gives players a mobility advantage by allowing them to leap using an iron axe. These kits not only provide varied gameplay but also cater to different playstyles, whether players prefer direct engagement or tactical evasion.

As you progress in the game, the interaction between these elements—dragon spawning, pathfinding, kit selection, and kit usage—will shape the gameplay experience, offering multiple strategies and playstyles for players to explore.
