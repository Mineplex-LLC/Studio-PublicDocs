## Gameplay Overview

- **Objective**: Stay alive as long as possible while the arena is destroyed around you.
- **Dragons**: Ender Dragons fly through the map, destroying blocks in their path. Their attacks are random, forcing players to stay constantly on the move.
- **Falling to the Void**: Once the terrain is destroyed, players must avoid falling into the void below. The last player standing is the winner.

## Key Features

- **Randomized Chaos**: No two rounds are the same, as the dragons attack unpredictably.
- **Dynamic Maps**: Each map offers unique layouts and challenges, from floating islands to precarious cliffs.
- **Survivor Skills**: Use agility, quick thinking, and strategic positioning to outlast your opponents.

## Strategies

- **Keep Moving**: Staying still makes you an easy target for dragons.
- **High Ground**: Being at a higher elevation can give you a slight advantage as the terrain crumbles.
- **Avoid Crowds**: Dragons tend to target areas with more players, so spreading out can help you stay safe.
- **Watch for Edges**: Be mindful of where you're standingâ€”one misstep can send you plummeting into the void.

**Dragons** is a thrilling test of survival instincts and adaptability, where only the bravest and most resourceful players can claim victory. Gather your courage and face the dragons in this timeless Mineplex classic!
