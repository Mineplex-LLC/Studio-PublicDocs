description: Listeners that handle game behavior during the `STARTED` state.

Once the game transitions to the `STARTED` state, players begin playing the game. During this phase, we'll need to handle various in-game events with listeners.

In this tutorial, we’ll cover the following listeners:
- Disabling hunger for players
- Teleporting players to the game map
- Handling the game start message
- Handling player death messages
- Changing players to spectator mode when they die
- Handling spectators

Later in this tutorial, we’ll dive into more advanced topics, including:
- Dragon spawning mechanics
- Sparkler dropping effects

Let’s get started by implementing these listeners to manage the gameplay experience!
