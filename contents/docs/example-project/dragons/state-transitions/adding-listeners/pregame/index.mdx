description: Setting up listeners for the PREGAME state
---

As the game transitions into the `PREGAME` state, it's essential to set up a series of Bukkit listeners to manage key aspects of the game logic.

### What are Pregame Listeners?
Pregame listeners are event handlers that manage the 'waiting for players' phase of your game. They help ensure a smooth transition into the `STARTED` state and handle important functionality before the action begins.

### Key Listeners to Implement
In our example project, we focus on these core listeners during the `PREGAME` state:
- **Game Start Countdown**: Handles the countdown timer leading up to the game start.
- **Player Join & Quit Handling**: Manages players joining or leaving during the pregame phase.

### Extra Polish
Once the basics are in place, we will enhance the player experience with additional listeners:
- **Scoreboard Listener**: Displays important game information on a dynamic scoreboard.
- **Bossbar Listener**: Adds a boss bar to show countdowns, messages, or progress indicators.
