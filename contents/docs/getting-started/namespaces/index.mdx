description: How to use the Project Namespaces on the Mineplex Studio.
---

 Projects on the Mineplex Studio can optionally be grouped together inside Namespaces. Grouping Projects together within a Namespace allows you to share resources such as purchases, player stats, player data, and more.

 By default, a Project is created inside its own independent Namespace. You can view and update a Project's Namespace from the `config/game-properties.yaml` file. You should exercise caution when changing a Namespace, since updates can be destructive and may cause your Project to lose access to existing resources inside its previous Namespace.
 
 Currently, the following resources are shared by all Projects inside a Namespace:
 - [Namespace Bans](/docs/sdk/features/moderation)
 - [Data Collections](/docs/sdk/features/data)
 - [Purchaseable Products and Subscriptions](/docs/sdk/features/purchase)
 - [Player Stats](/docs/sdk/features/stats)
 - [Leaderboards](/docs/sdk/features/leaderboard)
 - [Persistent World Buckets](/docs/sdk/features/world)
