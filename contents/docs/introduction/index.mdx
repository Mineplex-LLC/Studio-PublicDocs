## Mineplex Studio Overview

Welcome to **The Mineplex Studio**, The Studio empowered developers worldwide to create their own minigames and game networks within Minecraft, with cross-platform support, monetization, and infrastructure hosting built-in. The Studio platform massively lowered the barrier to entry for game development in Minecraft and is now publicly available.

Inspired by innovations in the gaming space from titles like Roblox and Fortnite, we
invented the Studio to empower our players to develop games surpassing those they previously
played on Mineplex servers and in other titles.
After the 2023 shutdown and restructure of the company, we received many requests to
relaunch both the Java and Bedrock servers, alongside an overwhelming interest in game
developer positions. While considering the skills and interests of the community, along with
Mineplex’s long-term goals of inspiring and empowering creators, we decided to create the
Studio to revolutionize the gaming infrastructure space.
