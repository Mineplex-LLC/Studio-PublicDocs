description: How to use the Mineplex Studio Game Engine Module.
---

The Game Engine Module is one of the built-in Studio Modules that allows you to create immersive and dynamic gameplay
experiences within Minecraft. Studio games are designed to be modular, allowing you to make amazing gameplay mechanics
that you can take with you from game to game, or even sell to other developers on our asset marketplace.

## Game Cycle

If you want to create a project where multiple games play one after another, you should create your own
custom `GameCycle`. To do so, you need to create a class that implements the `GameCycle` interface. You'll need to
determine how the `hasNextGame()` and `createNextGame()` methods should function. In some cases, you may want to cycle
through a specific number of games, while in others you may want the cycle to go on forever. Either way, you can control
it via your implementation of `hasNextGame()`. Your implementation of `createNextGame()` will determine what game is up
next, and will need to handle constructing the next game up. You can also have `getLobbyWorld()` return an
actual `MineplexWorld` if you want the players to be teleported to a lobby world in between games. By default, there is
no `GameCycle`, and a new game will not be created when the previous game ends.

## Game State

The state of a `MineplexGame` indicates what phase in the game lifecycle it is currently in. The `GameState` of
a `MineplexGame` can be retrieved using the `getGameState()` method, and set using the `setGameState(GameState)` method.

Built in options are:
- `PREPARING` - When the `MineplexGame` is first being setup after construction
- `PRE_START` - When the `MineplexGame` is preparing to start after all start conditions are met. This can be used for
  things like countdowns or other starting behaviors. This is the default state in which the Matchmaker will flag your
  game server as available for players
- `STARTED` - When the `MineplexGame` has officially started
- `ENDED` - When the `MineplexGame` is completed after the end condition is met. This can be used for things like win
  rooms or other end game behavior

## MineplexGame Interface

The `MineplexGame` interface is the primary interface for any game playable on the Studio. To make your own game, you'll
need to create a class for it that implements the `MineplexGame` interface. This class will define the core
functionality and gameplay, and is where you will pull in all the `GameMechanic`s that you want to incorporate. To
properly implement the `MineplexGame` interface, you will need to provide implementations for several methods. You will
need to implement the `getName()` method, which should be the `String` name for your game. You also need to implement
the `getGameModule()` method. You'll need to supply some way for your game to return the `MineplexGameModule` within
this method, either by passing the module in the game's constructor, or another way of your choosing. Next, you'll need
to implement the `getGameState()` and `setGameState(GameState)` methods. These can either actually modify your game's
state, or simply return `STARTED` for games that do not intend to support a full game lifecycle. Inside
the `setGameState` method, you should additionally fire the `MineplexGameStateChangeEvent` and propagate that new state
to each of the `GameMechanic`s your game is using via the `GameMechanic` method `onStateChange(GameState, GameState)`
prior to actually changing the `GameState` if you intend to do so. You will need to manage the conditions that trigger
game lifecycle changes yourself as well. Finally, you must implement the `setup()` and `teardown()` methods, to handle
allocating and deallocating assets for the game. This is where you should create, configure, and destroy any of
the `GameMechanic`s you want to use.

<Note>
    You don't have to call `setup()` or `teardown()` methods of `MineplexGame` manually. Respective methods will be
    called automatically when game is created using `GameCycle#createNextGame()`, and when game moves into ended state
    (that is, `MineplexGame#getGameState().isEnded()` returns `true`). However, you will need to handle registering and
    unregistering of your `MineplexGame` as a `Listener` yourself, based on your own conditions.
</Note>


There is a sub-interface, `SingleWorldMineplexGame`, that you may also choose to implement rather than just
the `MineplexGame` interface. This requires all the same implementations as a standard `MineplexGame`, with the
additional required method implementation of `getGameWorld()`, which should return the `MineplexWorld` serving as the
single world that game will take place within.

## Game Structure

Since this is a game that takes place in one game world, let's base it on the `SingleWorldMineplexGame`.

```java
public class HungerGames implements SingleWorldMineplexGame {
    private final JavaPlugin myProjectPlugin;
    private final MineplexGameModule gameModule;
    private GameState gameState;
    @Getter
    private final List<LivingEntity> players = new ArrayList<>();

    public HungerGames(final JavaPlugin myProjectPlugin, final MineplexGameModule gameModule) {
        this.myProjectPlugin = myProjectPlugin;
        this.gameModule = gameModule;
        this.gameState = GameState.PREPARING;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "Hunger Games";
    }

    @Override
    public MineplexGameModule getGameModule() {
        return gameModule;
    }

    @Override
    public GameState getGameState() {
        return gameState;
    }

    @Override
    public void setGameState(GameState gameState) {
        Bukkit.getPluginManager().callEvent(new MineplexGameStateChangeEvent(this,
                this.gameState, gameState));
        this.gameState = gameState;

        // When the game starts, teleport every player to a random spawn point
        if (this.gameState == GameState.STARTED) {
            final List<Location> spawns = getGameWorld().getDataPoints("SPAWN");
            players.forEach(player -> {
                final Location spawn = spawns.get(ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(spawns.size()));
                player.teleport(spawn);
            });
        } else if (this.gameState == GameState.ENDED) {
            setGameState(GameState.CLEANING_UP);
        } else if (this.gameState == GameState.CLEANING_UP) {
            teardown();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, myProjectPlugin);
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        HandlerList.unregisterAll(this);
        players.clear();
        gameModule.setCurrentGame(null);
    }

    @Override
    public MineplexWorld getGameWorld() {
        return null;
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onDeath(final PlayerDeathEvent event) {
        // If the game is currently ongoing
        if (gameState == GameState.STARTED) {
            // If the dead player was playing this game
            if (players.remove(event.getPlayer())) {
                // Put dead players in spectator mode
                event.getPlayer().setGameMode(GameMode.SPECTATOR);
                // If there is one player or less, end the game
                if (players.size() <= 1) {
                    setGameState(GameState.ENDED);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onJoin(final PlayerJoinEvent event) {
        // Automatically add new players to the game
        if (gameState == GameState.PRE_START) {
            players.add(event.getPlayer());
            // If 5 or more players are playing, start the game
            if (players.size() >= 5) {
                setGameState(GameState.STARTED);
            }
        }
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onQuit(final PlayerQuitEvent event) {
        // If the game is currently ongoing
        if (gameState == GameState.STARTED) {
            // If the exiting player was playing this game
            if (players.remove(event.getPlayer())) {
                // Put exiting players in spectator mode
                event.getPlayer().setGameMode(GameMode.SPECTATOR);
                // If there is one player or less, end the game
                if (players.size() <= 1) {
                    setGameState(GameState.ENDED);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```

Next, let's enable and configure the mechanics we want!
(View full information on `GameMechanic` [here](/docs/sdk/features/game/mechanics)).

## Game Mechanics Configuration

For a very basic hunger games, we'll want
the `KitMechanic`, `AbilityMechanic`, `GameWorldSelectorMechanic`, `LootChestMechanic`, and `TeamMechanic` with
a `SingleTeamAssigner`. Let's take a look at how our `HungerGames` class changes to do this.

```java
 public class HungerGames implements SingleWorldMineplexGame {
    private final JavaPlugin myProjectPlugin;
    private final MineplexGameModule gameModule;
    private final MineplexGameMechanicFactory gameMechanicFactory;
    private GameState gameState;

    @Getter
    private final List<LivingEntity> players = new ArrayList<>();

    private AbilityMechanic abilityMechanic;
    private KitMechanic kitMechanic;
    private GameWorldSelectorMechanic gameWorldSelectorMechanic;
    private LootChestMechanic lootChestMechanic;
    private TeamMechanic teamMechanic;

    public HungerGames(final JavaPlugin myProjectPlugin, final MineplexGameModule gameModule, final MineplexGameMechanicFactory gameMechanicFactory) {
        this.myProjectPlugin = myProjectPlugin;
        this.gameModule = gameModule;
        this.gameMechanicFactory = gameMechanicFactory;
        this.gameState = GameState.PREPARING;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "Hunger Games";
    }

    @Override
    public MineplexGameModule getGameModule() {
        return gameModule;
    }

    @Override
    default MineplexGameMechanicFactory getGameMechanicFactory() {
        return gameMechanicFactory;
    }

    @Override
    public GameState getGameState() {
        return gameState;
    }

    @Override
    public void setGameState(GameState gameState) {
        Bukkit.getPluginManager().callEvent(new MineplexGameStateChangeEvent(this,
                this.gameState,
                gameState));
        abilityMechanic.onStateChange(this.gameState, gameState);
        kitMechanic.onStateChange(this.gameState, gameState);
        gameWorldSelectorMechanic.onStateChange(this.gameState, gameState);
        lootChestMechanic.onStateChange(this.gameState, gameState);
        teamMechanic.onStateChange(this.gameState, gameState);
        this.gameState = gameState;

        // When the game starts, teleport every player to a random spawn point, assign teams, and give them the kit
        if (this.gameState == GameState.STARTED) {
            final List<Location> spawns = getGameWorld().getDataPoints("SPAWN");
            players.forEach(player -> {
                final Location spawn = spawns.get(ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(spawns.size()));
                player.teleport(spawn);

                kitMechanic.grantKit(player, PlayerKit.class);
            });
            teamMechanic.assignTeams(players, teamMechanic.constructTeamAssigner(SingleTeamAssigner.class)
                    .get());
        } else if (this.gameState == GameState.ENDED) {
            setGameState(GameState.CLEANING_UP);
        } else if (this.gameState == GameState.CLEANING_UP) {
            teardown();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        gameWorldSelectorMechanic = gameMechanicFactory.construct(GameWorldSelectorMechanic.class);
        kitMechanic = gameMechanicFactory.construct(KitMechanic.class);
        abilityMechanic = gameMechanicFactory.construct(AbilityMechanic.class);
        lootChestMechanic = gameMechanicFactory.construct(LootChestMechanic.class);
        teamMechanic = gameMechanicFactory.construct(TeamMechanic.class);

        gameWorldSelectorMechanic.setup(this);
        kitMechanic.setup(this);
        abilityMechanic.setup(this);

        // 60 seconds * 20 ticks per second
        lootChestMechanic.setChestRefillDelay(60 * 20L);
        lootChestMechanic.setChestDataPointKey("CHEST");
        // Loot pool, with a minimum of 3 items per chest and a max of 9
        lootChestMechanic.setChestLootPool(List.of(
                new ItemStack(Material.IRON_SWORD),
                new ItemStack(Material.DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE),
                new ItemStack(Material.WOODEN_SWORD),
                new ItemStack(Material.GOLDEN_APPLE),
                new ItemStack(Material.CHAINMAIL_HELMET),
                new ItemStack(Material.BREAD, 5),
                new ItemStack(Material.EGG, 16),
                new ItemStack(Material.SNOWBALL, 10),
                new ItemStack(Material.DIAMOND_AXE)), 3, 9);
        lootChestMechanic.setup(this);

        teamMechanic.setup(this);
        teamMechanic.registerTeam("Players", Component.text("Players"));

        // Register our kit
        kitMechanic.registerKit(PlayerKit.class, new PlayerKit(kitMechanic, abilityMechanic, this));

        Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, myProjectPlugin);
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        HandlerList.unregisterAll(this);

        kitMechanic.teardown();
        abilityMechanic.teardown();
        teamMechanic.teardown();
        lootChestMechanic.teardown();
        gameWorldSelectorMechanic.teardown();

        players.clear();
        gameModule.setCurrentGame(null);
    }

    @Override
    public MineplexWorld getGameWorld() {
        return gameWorldSelectorMechanic.getSelectedGameWorld();
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onDeath(final PlayerDeathEvent event) {
        // If the game is currently ongoing
        if (gameState == GameState.STARTED) {
            // If the dead player was playing this game
            if (players.remove(event.getPlayer())) {
                // Put dead players in spectator mode and remove their kit
                event.getPlayer().setGameMode(GameMode.SPECTATOR);
                kitMechanic.removeKit(event.getPlayer(), PlayerKit.class);
                // If there is one player or less, end the game
                if (players.size() <= 1) {
                    setGameState(GameState.ENDED);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onJoin(final PlayerJoinEvent event) {
        // Automatically add new players to the game
        if (gameState == GameState.PRE_START) {
            players.add(event.getPlayer());

            // If 5 or more players are playing, start the game
            if (players.size() >= 5) {
                setGameState(GameState.STARTED);
            }
        }
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onQuit(final PlayerQuitEvent event) {
        // If the game is currently ongoing
        if (gameState == GameState.STARTED) {
            // If the exiting player was playing this game
            if (players.remove(event.getPlayer())) {
                // Put exiting players in spectator mode and remove their kit
                event.getPlayer().setGameMode(GameMode.SPECTATOR);
                kitMechanic.removeKit(event.getPlayer(), PlayerKit.class);
                // If there is one player or less, end the game
                if (players.size() <= 1) {
                    setGameState(GameState.ENDED);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```

Finally, let's look at how our game gets started!

## Project Plugin Class

 ```java
 public class MyProject extends JavaPlugin {
    private HungerGames game;

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        final MineplexGameModule gameModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(
                MineplexGameModule.class);
        game = new HungerGames(this, gameModule);
        gameModule.setCurrentGame(game);
        game.setGameState(GameState.PRE_START);
    }

    @Override
    public void onDisable() {
        game.teardown();
    }
}
 ```
