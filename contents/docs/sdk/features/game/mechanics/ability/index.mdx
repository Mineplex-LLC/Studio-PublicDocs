### Mechanic

The `AbilityMechanic` is one of the built-in `GameMechanic`s bundled with the Studio SDK. This mechanic allows you to
create `Ability`s and grant/remove them to/from `LivingEntity`s. `Ability`s can be tightly coupled to a
specific `MineplexGame`, or left generic to support a wide variety of games.

#### Interface

The base `Ability` interface defines a few methods that must be implemented by any specific `Ability`. These include
methods like getting the name of the `Ability`, setup and teardown methods for the `Ability` instance, and start and
stop methods for when the `Ability` is granted to/removed from a specific `LivingEntity`.
In addition to the base `Ability` interface, there are two specific types of `Ability`: `PassiveAbility`, an interface
that defines an `Ability` which is constantly running as long as a `LivingEntity` possesses it, which may grant
the `LivingEntity` passive bonuses like fall damage reduction or regeneration, and `ActiveAbility`, which performs some
specific action when triggered. The specific `Ability` is required to implement the passive granted by
the `PassiveAbility`, as well as listening for the trigger of an `ActiveAbility` and implementing the activation and
deactivation behavior. All registered `Ability`s function as `Listener`s, and do not have to be explicitly
registered/unregistered with Bukkit by you.

#### Factory

An `AbilityFactory` provides for the dynamic construction of instances of a specific `Ability`. To function, the factory
needs to be registered in the `AbilityMechanic` using
the `registerAbilityFactory(Class<A extends Ability<G extends MineplexGame>>, AbilityFactory<G, A>)` method. Once the
factory has been registered, you can use the `AbilityMechanic` to construct instances of the `Ability` using
the `constructAbility(Class<A extends Ability<G extends MineplexGame>>, G)` method. All built-in `Ability`s that we
provide have their factories pre-registered in the `AbilityMechanic`, so all you have to do is construct an instance
when you want to use them. You do not need to create an `AbilityFactory` for your own custom `Ability`s, but you can if
you'd like to. You will need to implement your own `AbilityFactory` if you plan to sell source-unavailable `Ability`s to
other developers on our asset marketplace.

# Examples
## Passive Ability

Let's make a custom passive ability that makes players take no fall damage.

```java
// Since this ability doesn't need to do anything specific to Hunger Games, we can make it generic,
// so we can reuse it!
@AllArgsConstructor
public class WeightlessAbility implements PassiveAbility<MineplexGame> {
    private final AbilityMechanic abilityMechanic;
    private final MineplexGame game;

    @Override
    public AbilityMechanic getAbilityMechanic() {
        return abilityMechanic;
    }

    @Override
    public MineplexGame getGame() {
        return game;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "Weightless";
    }

    @Override
    public void setup(final MineplexGame game) {
        // This ability doesn't need to allocate any additional resources
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        // This ability has no additionally allocated resources to clean up
    }

    @Override
    public void start(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        // This ability doesn't do anything to the host when it starts
    }

    @Override
    public void stop(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        // This ability doesn't do anything to the host that needs to be removed
    }

    @Override
    public void tick(LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        // This ability doesn't do anything on every tick
    }

    // Stop fall damage
    @EventHandler
    public void onFallDamage(final EntityDamageEvent event) {
        // If the entity taking damage has this ability
        if (event.getEntity() instanceof LivingEntity livingEntity && hasAbility(livingEntity)) {
            // Only cancel fall damage
            if (event.getCause() == EntityDamageEvent.DamageCause.FALL) {
                event.setCancelled(true);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```java
// Since this ability doesn't need to do anything specific to Hunger Games, we can make it generic,
// so we can reuse it!
@AllArgsConstructor
public class SneakyAbility implements ActiveAbility<MineplexGame> {
    private final AbilityMechanic abilityMechanic;
    private final MineplexGame game;

    @Override
    public AbilityMechanic getAbilityMechanic() {
        return abilityMechanic;
    }

    @Override
    public MineplexGame getGame() {
        return game;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "Sneaky";
    }

    @Override
    public void setup(final MineplexGame game) {
        // This ability doesn't need to allocate any additional resources
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        // This ability has no additionally allocated resources to clean up
    }

    @Override
    public void start(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        // This ability doesn't do anything to the host when it starts
    }

    @Override
    public void stop(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        livingEntity.removePotionEffect(PotionEffectType.INVISIBILITY);
    }

    @Override
    public void activate(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        // Grant 10 seconds of invisibility
        livingEntity.addPotionEffect(new PotionEffect(PotionEffectType.INVISIBILITY,
                // 10 seconds * 20 ticks per second
                10 * 20,
                // Invisibility level 1, no need for an amplifier
                0,
                // This is not an ambient effect
                false,
                // We don't want to give away the player with potion particles
                false,
                // We do want the potion effect icon to show up on the player's screen
                true));
    }

    @Override
    public void deactivate(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        livingEntity.removePotionEffect(PotionEffectType.INVISIBILITY);
    }

    // Listen for crouching
    @EventHandler
    public void onCrouch(final PlayerToggleSneakEvent event) {
        // If the player has this ability
        if (hasAbility(event.getPlayer()) && event.isSneaking()) {
            // If they are crouching, activate, otherwise, deactivate
            if (event.isSneaking()) {
                activate(event.getPlayer());
            } else {
                deactivate(event.getPlayer());
            }
        }
    }
}
