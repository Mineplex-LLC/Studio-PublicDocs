description: How to use the built-in Mineplex Studio Game Mechanics.
---

The Studio SDK comes with extensive built-in Game Mechanics that provide foundational functionality for all Studio
projects. These built-in Game Mechanics are automatically registered, and can be accessed via
the `MineplexGameMechanicFactory` method `construct(Class<T extends GameMechanic<? extends MineplexGame>)`

## Pricing

Built-in mechanics are provided free-of-charge!

## Example

Let's say we want to use the `Ability` mechanic in our project. As a very first step, we need to get
a new instance of it.

```java
public class ExampleGame implements MineplexGame {
    private final MineplexGameMechanicFactory gameMechanicFactory =
            MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(MineplexGameMechanicFactory.class);

    private AbilityMechanic abilityMechanic;
    
    @Override
    public void setup() {
        this.abilityMechanic = this.gameMechanicFactory.construct(AbilityMechanic.class);
        this.abilityMechanic.setup(this);
        
        // TODO: Register your own abilities here
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        this.abilityMechanic.teardown();
    }
}
```

<Note type="warning">
    Constructing a `GameMechanic` through `MineplexGameMechanicFactory` will not cause Studio Engine to call neither of its `setup()` nor `teardown()` methods.
    You might call both `setup()` and `teardown()` on your own as needed.
