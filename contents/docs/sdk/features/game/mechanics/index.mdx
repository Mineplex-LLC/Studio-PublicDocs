`GameMechanic`s are discrete elements of gameplay that create a full game when all operating together. These mechanics
can be tightly coupled to a specific `MineplexGame`, or left generic to support a wide variety of games. We provide
several built-in `GameMechanic`s with the Studio SDK, but you can also make your own mechanics to customize your game
projects. You can even create unique `GameMechanic`s and sell them to other developers on our asset
marketplace! `GameMechanic`s should register and unregister themselves as `Listener`s in their setup and teardown
methods, **which should be called manually** when an owning `MineplexGame` initializes and cleans them up.

## Built-in Mineplex Studio Game Mechanics
The Studio SDK comes with extensive built-in Game Mechanics that provide foundational functionality for all Studio
projects. These built-in Game Mechanics are automatically registered, and can be accessed via
the `MineplexGameMechanicFactory` method `construct(Class<T extends GameMechanic<? extends MineplexGame>)`

### Pricing

Built-in mechanics are provided free-of-charge!

## Custom Game Mechanics

Implementing your own custom `GameMechanic`s is easy to do: just create a new class that implements the `GameMechanic`
interface, and determine if you want a mechanic that is coupled to a game, for example `BossMechanic<BossGame>`, or a
more generic mechanic, such as `SpectatorMechanic<MineplexGame>`. In your custom class, you will need to implement
the `setup(Game)`, `teardown()`, and `onStateChange(GameState, GameState) - todo: what is this` methods to define the custom behavior of your
mechanic for each of those cases.

Let's try making a custom `GameMechanic` that makes players glow for a moment when they get hit.

 ```java
@AllArgsConstructor
public class DamageGlowMechanic implements GameMechanic<MineplexGame> {
    private final MineplexGame game;
    private final JavaPlugin myProjectPlugin;

    @Override
    public void setup(final MineplexGame game) {
        Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, myProjectPlugin);
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        HandlerList.unregisterAll(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void onStateChange(final GameState fromState, final GameState toState) {
        // Nothing needs to be cleaned up on state change
    }

    // On damage, make players glow
    @EventHandler(priority = EventPriority.MONITOR, ignoreCancelled = true)
    public void onDamage(final EntityDamageEvent event) {
        if (event.getEntity() instanceof Player player) {
            // If the game is ongoing
            if (game.getGameState() == GameState.STARTED) {
                // If the player taking damage is in the game
                if (game.getPlayers().contains(player)) {
                    // Make them glow for a bit
                    player.addPotionEffect(new PotionEffect(PotionEffectType.GLOWING,
                            // 5 seconds * 20 ticks per second
                            5 * 20,
                            // No need for a higher level of glowing
                            0,
                            // Not an ambient effect
                            false,
                            // No need for particles
                            false,
                            // No need for the potion effect icon
                            false));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```

## Game Mechanic Factory

A `GameMechanicFactory` provides for the dynamic construction of instances of a specific `GameMechanic`.
To function, the factory needs to be registered in the `MineplexGameMechanicFactory`
using the `<M extends GameMechanic<?>> register(Class<M> gameMechanic, Supplier<M> mechanicSupplier)` method.
Once the factory has been registered, you can use the `MineplexGameMechanicFactory`
to construct instances of the `GameMechanic` using the `construct(Class<M extends GameMechanic<?>>)` method.
All built-in `GameMechanic`s that we provide have their factories pre-registered in the `MineplexGameMechanicFactory`,
so all you have to do is construct an instance when you want to use them.
You do not need to create a `GameMechanicFactory` for your own custom `GameMechanic`s, but you can if you'd like to.
You will need
to implement your own `GameMechanicFactory` if you plan to sell source-unavailable `GameMechanic`s to other developers
on our asset marketplace.

### Example

Let's register and construct the mechanic we just implemented above:

```java

public class ExampleGame implements MineplexGame {
    private final MineplexGameMechanicFactory gameMechanicFactory =
            MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(MineplexGameMechanicFactory.class);

    private DamageGlowMechanic damageGlowMechanic;

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        // Register mechanic supplier to be used for construction
        this.gameMechanicFactory.register(DamageGlowMechanic.class, DamageGlowMechanic::new);

        // Construct new instance of mechanic using registered supplier
        this.damageGlowMechanic = this.gameMechanicFactory.construct(DamageGlowMechanic.class);

        // Set up freshly created instance!
        this.damageGlowMechanic.setup(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        // Don't forget to free any resources this mechanic might've allocated
        this.damageGlowMechanic.teardown();
    }

    ...
}

```

## Example

Let's say we want to use the [`Ability`](/docs/sdk/features/game/mechanics/ability) mechanic in our project. As a very first step, we need to get
a new instance of it.

```java
public class ExampleGame implements MineplexGame {
    private final MineplexGameMechanicFactory gameMechanicFactory =
            MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(MineplexGameMechanicFactory.class);

    private AbilityMechanic abilityMechanic;
    
    @Override
    public void setup() {
        this.abilityMechanic = this.gameMechanicFactory.construct(AbilityMechanic.class);
        this.abilityMechanic.setup(this);
        
        // TODO: Register your own abilities here
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        this.abilityMechanic.teardown();
    }
}
```
