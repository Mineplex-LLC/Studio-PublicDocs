description: How to use the Kit Game Mechanic.

### Mechanic

The `KitMechanic` is one of the built-in `GameMechanic`s bundled with the Studio SDK. This mechanic allows you to
create `Kit`s and grant/remove them to/from `LivingEntity`s. `Kit`s can be tightly coupled to a specific `MineplexGame`,
or left generic to support a wide variety of games.

#### Interface

The `Kit` interface defines a few methods that must be implemented by any specific `Kit`. These include methods like
getting the name of the `Kit`, setup and teardown methods for the `Kit` instance, and a `giveKit(LivingEntity)` method
called whenever your game wishes to give the kit to a specific `LivingEntity` that has the kit (such as on game start,
or respawns). The interface also has a `removeKit(LivingEntity)` method called when the kit is removed from
a `LivingEntity`. All registered `Kit`s function as `Listener`s, and do not have to be explicitly
registered/unregistered with Bukkit by you.

#### Factory

A `KitFactory` provides for the dynamic construction of instances of a specific `Kit`. To function, the factory needs to
be registered in the `KitMechanic` using
the `registerKitFactory(Class<K extends Kit<G extends MineplexGame>>, KitFactory<G, K>)` method. Once the factory has
been registered, you can use the `KitMechanic` to construct instances of the `Kit` using
the `constructKit(Class<K extends Kit<G extends MineplexGame>>, G)` method. All built-in `Kit`s that we provide have
their factories pre-registered in the `KitMechanic`, so all you have to do is construct an instance when you want to use
them. You do not need to create a `KitFactory` for your own custom `Kit`s, but you can if you'd like to. You will need
to implement your own `KitFactory` if you plan to sell source-unavailable `Kit`s to other developers on our asset
marketplace.

## Examples
## Player Kit

Let's give each player some leather armor and a stone sword when they start, as well as our two abilities.

```java
// Since this kit doesn't need to do anything specific to Hunger Games,
// we can make it generic, so we can reuse it!
public class PlayerKit implements Kit<MineplexGame> {
    // We want to give our two abilities to anyone with this kit
    private final WeightlessAbility weightlessAbility;
    private final SneakyAbility sneakyAbility;
    private final AbilityMechanic abilityMechanic;
    private final KitMechanic kitMechanic;
    private final MineplexGame game;

    public PlayerKit(final KitMechanic kitMechanic,
                     final AbilityMechanic abilityMechanic,
                     final MineplexGame game) {
        weightlessAbility = new WeightlessAbility(abilityMechanic, game);
        sneakyAbility = new SneakyAbility(abilityMechanic, game);
        this.abilityMechanic = abilityMechanic;
        this.kitMechanic = kitMechanic;
        this.game = game;
    }

    @Override
    public KitMechanic getKitMechanic() {
        return kitMechanic;
    }

    @Override
    public MineplexGame getGame() {
        return game;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "Player";
    }

    @Override
    public void setup(final MineplexGame game) {
        abilityMechanic.registerAbility(WeightlessAbility.class, weightlessAbility);
        abilityMechanic.registerAbility(SneakyAbility.class, sneakyAbility);
    }

    @Override
    public void teardown() {
        abilityMechanic.destroyAbility(WeightlessAbility.class);
        abilityMechanic.destroyAbility(SneakyAbility.class);
    }

    @Override
    public void giveKit(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        if (!abilityMechanic.hasAbility(livingEntity, WeightlessAbility.class)) {
            abilityMechanic.grantAbility(livingEntity, WeightlessAbility.class);
        }

        if (!abilityMechanic.hasAbility(livingEntity, SneakyAbility.class)) {
            abilityMechanic.grantAbility(livingEntity, SneakyAbility.class);
        }

        final EntityEquipment equipment = livingEntity.getEquipment();
        equipment.setHelmet(new ItemStack(Material.LEATHER_HELMET));
        equipment.setChestplate(new ItemStack(Material.LEATHER_CHESTPLATE));
        equipment.setLeggings(new ItemStack(Material.LEATHER_LEGGINGS));
        equipment.setBoots(new ItemStack(Material.LEATHER_BOOTS));
        equipment.setItemInMainHand(new ItemStack(Material.STONE_SWORD));
    }

    @Override
    public void removeKit(final LivingEntity livingEntity) {
        if (abilityMechanic.hasAbility(livingEntity, WeightlessAbility.class)) {
            abilityMechanic.removeAbility(livingEntity, WeightlessAbility.class);
        }

        if (abilityMechanic.hasAbility(livingEntity, SneakyAbility.class)) {
            abilityMechanic.removeAbility(livingEntity, SneakyAbility.class);
        }
    }
}
