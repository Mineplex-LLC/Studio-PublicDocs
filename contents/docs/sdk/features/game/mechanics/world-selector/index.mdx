### GameWorldSelector Mechanic

The `GameWorldSelectorMechanic` is one of the built-in `GameMechanic`s bundled with the Studio SDK. This mechanic will
randomly select a map from the game map templates included in your project, load the `MineplexWorld` from the template,
and then provide it to the `MineplexGame` using the mechanic. Once the `MineplexGame` cleans itself up,
the `GameWorldSelectorMechanic` will unload the `MineplexWorld` and clean it up as well.
