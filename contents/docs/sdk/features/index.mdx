description: How to use the built-in Mineplex Studio Modules.

<JavadocLink classpath="com.mineplex.studio.sdk.modules.MineplexModule"/>

The Studio SDK comes with extensive built-in Modules that provide foundational functionality for all Studio projects. These built-in Modules are automatically registered and enabled on startup, and can be accessed via the `MineplexModuleManager` method `getRegisteredModule(Class<T extends MineplexModule>)`. You should **never** manually destroy or disable these Modules.

## Pricing (usually free!)
Built-in modules are provided free-of-charge, with some restrictions, for developers that use a profit-sharing payout model (this probably applies to you!).

We also offer a metered pricing tier to select game publishers, with minimum revenue and support model requirements. Built-in Modules are generally significantly cheaper than hosting other services or using equivalent functionalities provided outside the Studio.

## Example
Let's say we want to create a new `MineplexWorld` in our project. As a very first step, we need to get the `MineplexWorldModule`.

```java
public void createWorlds() {
    final MineplexWorldModule worldModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(MineplexWorldModule.class);

    // Now create worlds...
}
```

Now that we have the module, we can proceed with world creation.
