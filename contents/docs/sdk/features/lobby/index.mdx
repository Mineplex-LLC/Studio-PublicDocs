The `LobbyModule` is a module for managing the lobby world in the Mineplex system. It provides methods for creating, setting, and retrieving active lobby.

## Key Features
- Create a Lobby: Create a new `StudioLobby` instance by providing a `MineplexWorld`.
- Set a Lobby: Creating a lobby by itself does not do anything. For lobby to be registered, it has to be explicitly set.
- Retrieve Active Lobby: Returns currently active `StudioLobby` instance, that was set before.

## Creating and Setting a Lobby
To create and activate a lobby, use the Module's `createBasicLobby` method followed by `setActiveLobby`:

```java
final LobbyModule lobbyModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(LobbyModule.class);
final MineplexWorld lobbyWorld = ... // MineplexWorld to be used as lobby. see WorldModule for instructions on world creation
final StudioLobby lobby = lobbyModule.createBasicLobby(lobbyWorld);
lobbyModule.setActiveLobby(lobby);
lobbyModule.setup();
```

## Joining the Lobby
Whenever player joins the game, they will be respawned in the same world and location they left from,
as long as there is such world and it is still valid. If player connects to the container for the first time,
or the world they were in is no longer valid, they will be respawned in the active lobby, as long as one exists,
at the world spawn location.

Once game reaches end state, (that is, `MineplexGame#getGameState().isEnded()` returns `true`), all players will be
teleported back to the active lobby.


<Note type="warning">
    Even if active game exists and contains a valid `MineplexWorld`, players will not be teleported to it from lobby.
    All teleportation from lobby to the game have to be done manually.
</Note>
