The `LobbyModule` is a module for managing the pre-game waiting lobby world in the Mineplex system.
Lobbies traditionally contain functionality for players that they can use while waiting for the upcoming game, such as:
- Team Selection
- Kit Selection
- Map Voting
- Statistics NPC

Module provides methods for creating, setting, retrieving and interacting with the active lobby.

## Key Features
- Create a Lobby: Create a new `StudioLobby` instance by providing a `MineplexWorld`.
- Set a Lobby: Make `StudioLobby` instance become the active lobby.
- Retrieve Active Lobby: Returns currently active `StudioLobby` instance that was set before.
- Checking for player presence in a lobby.

## Creating and Setting a Lobby
To create and activate a lobby, use the Module's `createBasicLobby` method followed by `setActiveLobby`:
```java
final LobbyModule lobbyModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(LobbyModule.class);
final MineplexWorld lobbyWorld = ... // MineplexWorld to be used as lobby. see MineplexWorldModule for instructions on world creation
final StudioLobby lobby = lobbyModule.createBasicLobby(lobbyWorld);
lobbyModule.setActiveLobby(lobby);
lobbyModule.setup();
```

View full information on `MineplexWorldModule` [here](/docs/sdk/features/world).

## Checking for Player Presence
To check if player is currently in a lobby world, use the StudioLobby's `isInLobby` method:
```java
final Player player = ... // player to check for
final LobbyModule lobbyModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(LobbyModule.class);
final Optional<StudioLobby> lobbyOption = lobbyModule.getActiveLobby();
final boolean isPlayerInLobby = lobbyOption.map(lobby -> lobby.isInLobby(player)).orElse(false);
```

## Joining the Lobby
Whenever a player joins the game, they will be respawned in the same world and location they left from,
as long as there is such world and it is still valid. If a player connects to the container for the first time,
or the world they were in is no longer valid, they will be respawned in the active lobby, as long as one exists,
at the world spawn location.

Once game reaches end state, (that is, `MineplexGame#getGameState().isEnded()` returns `true`), all players will be
teleported back to the active lobby.


<Note type="warning">
    Even if active game exists and contains a valid `MineplexWorld`, players will not be teleported to it from lobby.
    All teleportation from lobby to the game have to be done manually.
</Note>
