The Punishment interface defines the structure and behavior of a punishment entity. It includes methods to access punishment details, check conditions, and compute properties such as its remaining duration or global applicability.

## Default Implementation: PunishmentImpl

The `PunishmentImpl` class provides a concrete implementation of the Punishment interface. It represents a punishment applied to an offline player and includes details about the player, moderator, reason, and scope of the punishment.

### Key Features

- Builder Pattern: Uses Lombok's @Builder annotation for convenient instantiation.
- Immutable Data: Defined with Lombok's @Value for immutabilsity.
- Default Values: Provides default values for fields like startTimestamp, removalInformation, and notes.

### Fields
- playerId (UUID): The UUID of the punished player.
- moderatorId (UUID): The UUID of the moderator who issued the punishment.
- startTimestamp (Instant): The timestamp when the punishment was applied (default: current time).
- applicableProjects (`Set<String>`): The set of projects the punishment applies to.
- punishmentReason (PunishmentReason): The reason for the punishment.
- removalInformation (PunishmentRemoval): Information about the removal of the punishment (default: null).
- identifier (UUID): The unique identifier of the punishment (default: null).
- notes (String): Additional notes or comments about the punishment (default: null).

### Usage Example:
```java
final PunishmentImpl punishment = PunishmentImpl.builder()
    .playerId(UUID.fromString("123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"))
    .moderatorId(UUID.fromString("223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"))
    .startTimestamp(Instant.now())
    .applicableProjects(Set.of(Objects.requireNonNull(System.getenv("MINEPLEX_PROJECT_ID"))))
    .punishmentReason(BuiltInReason.HACKING_ESCALATION)
    .notes("https://evidence.com")
    .build();
```

## Method Overview

### Identification Methods

#### `hasIdentifier()`
- Checks if the punishment has a unique identifier.
- Returns: `true` if the identifier exists, otherwise `false`.

#### `getIdentifier()`
- Retrieves the unique identifier for the punishment.
- Returns: `Optional<UUID>` containing the identifier if available.

### Player and Moderator Information

#### `getPlayerId()`
- Retrieves the UUID of the punished player.
- Returns: UUID of the player.

#### `hasModeratorId()`
- Checks if the punishment has a moderator ID.
- Returns: true if a moderator ID exists, otherwise false.

#### `getModeratorId()`
- Retrieves the UUID of the moderator who issued the punishment.
- Returns: `Optional<UUID>` containing the moderator ID if available.

### Timing Information

#### `getStartTimestamp()`
- Retrieves the timestamp when the punishment was issued or should begin.
- Returns: Instant representing the start time.

#### `getRemainingDuration()`
- Computes the remaining duration of the punishment.
- Returns: Duration of the remaining time.

<Note title="Important Note" type="danger" >
If a punishment is permanent, you will receive `Duration.ZERO` in return from this method
</Note>

### Applicability and Scope

#### `getApplicableProjects()`
- Retrieves the set of project IDs where the punishment applies.
- Returns: `Set<String>` containing applicable project IDs.

#### `appliesTo(String projectIdentifier)`
Checks if the punishment applies to a specific project.

**Parameters:**
- projectIdentifier: The project ID to check.
