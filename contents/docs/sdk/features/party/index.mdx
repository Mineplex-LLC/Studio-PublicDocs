<JavadocLink classpath="com.mineplex.studio.sdk.modules.party.PartyModule"/>

The Party Module is one of the built-in Studio Modules that allows you to query whether players in your game are in a party, and determine who is in the party with them. These methods are solely for you to integrate our parties into your games. All party functionality is handled internally by the SDK and requires no further implementation on your end.

## Retrieving a Party

Depending on the circumstances, a player's party data may have not been loaded yet. You can use either `isLoaded(OfflinePlayer)` or `isLoaded(UUID)` to check if their party data has been loaded.

Fetching a party can be done using its ID via `getPartyById(String)` or by a given player using `getPartyOfPlayer(Player)`. 

```java
final PartyModule partyModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(PartyModule.class);
if (partyModule.isLoaded(player)) {
    // Safe to check if they have a party.
    final Optional<Party> party = partyModule.getPartyOfPlayer(player);
}
```

## Retrieving Party Details

Once you've retrieved a party, you can access its ID, its leader, and all players in the party.

### Party ID

All parties have a unique ID assigned that can be retrieved via `getId()`.

```java
final String partyId = party.getId();
```

### Party Members

<Note type="warning">
    There is no guarantee that players in the party will be online in the running instance.
</Note>

#### Retrieving Party Leader 

Given a party, you can call `getOwner()` to return a `OfflinePlayer` of the owner of the party.

```java
final OfflinePlayer partyLeader = party.getOwner();
if (partyLeader.isOnline()) {
    Bukkit.broadcast(Component.text("Party leader is in-game!"));
} else {
    Bukkit.broadcast(Component.text("Party leader is not in this game!"));
}
```

#### Retrieving Party Members

Party members can be retrieved from a party by calling `listMembers(boolean)` with the argument being whether to include the party owner in the returned collection of `OfflinePlayer` objects.

```java
final OfflinePlayer partyOwner = party.getOwner();

// We specified false, meaning that this will NOT include the party leader.
for (final OfflinePlayer offlinePlayer : party.listMembers(false)) {
    if (offlinePlayer.isOnline()) {
        final Player player = (Player) offlinePlayer;
        player.sendMessage(Component.text("You are a party member of " + partyOwner.getName() + "!"));
    }
}
```

#### Checking Party Members

You can also verify that a player is a member of a party via `hasMember(OfflinePlayer)` or `hasMember(UUID)`, where the UUID is the UUID of the player you are checking.

```java
final boolean isPartyMember = party.hasMember(player);
if (isPartyMember) {
    player.sendMessage(Component.text("You are a member of this party!"));
}
```


## Example
Let's say we are making an open-world game where players can use the party system to team up. We don't want to allow players in the same party to hurt one another, so we integrate with the party module.
```java
public boolean canDamage(final Player damager, final Player victim) {
    final Optional<Party> damagerParty = partyModule.getPartyOfPlayer(damager);

    // If the attacker's party has the victim, we cannot attack them.
    final boolean damagerPartyContainsVictim = damagerParty.map(party -> party.hasMember(victim)).orElse(false);
    return !damagerPartyContainsVictim;
}
```
