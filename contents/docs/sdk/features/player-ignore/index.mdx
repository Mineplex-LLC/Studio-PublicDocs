The Player Ignore Module is one of the built-in Studio Modules that allows you to check which players are ignoring each other. 
This can be useful for creating custom chat filters, or for creating custom moderation tools.

## Module Retrieval
You can retrieve the module by using the ``MineplexModuleManager`` via 
```java
import com.mineplex.studio.sdk.modules.MineplexModuleManager;
PlayerIgnoreModule ignoreModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(PlayerIgnoreModule.class);
```

## Checking if a Player is Ignoring Another
You can check if a player is ignoring another player by using the `isIgnoring(OfflinePlayer, OfflinePlayer)` or `isIgnoring(UUID, UUID)` method.
In this example we are checking if `player` is ignoring `toCheck`. This will also return `true` if the data for `player` is not loaded.
You can use `isLoaded(OfflinePlayer)` and `isLoaded(UUUID)` to check if the data is loaded.
```java
public boolean isIgnoring(Player player, Player toCheck) {
    return ignoreModule.isIgnoring(player, target);
}
```
