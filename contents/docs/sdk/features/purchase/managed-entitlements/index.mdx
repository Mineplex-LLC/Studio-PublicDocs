description: How to use pre-built unlockable rewards (known as "Managed Entitlements")

Typically, product and subscription offerings within a Studio project require custom logic to grant some entitlement to the user after they are unlocked.

For example, if a player purchases a custom cosmetic in a game, the game code needs to listen for the purchase event and grant the user the appropriate access after their transaction is confirmed.

Managed Entitlements are special types of products or subscriptions that instead rely on Mineplex to grant access to some entitlement after a purchase is confirmed. This means that you do not need to write any custom code to grant the entitlements to the player after a purchase is made, and you instead configure the Managed Entitlement from the product or subscription definition YAML file.

<Note type="note">
- By default, Managed Entitlements still emit purchase callback events and must be acknowledged by the game server (even if the handler is a no-op)
</Note>

## High Level Technical Flow
For a managed entitlement purchase, the high-level technical flow is as follows:
<Step>
  <StepItem title="Player Prompts Purchase">
    A player takes an in-game action that triggers the `promptPurchase` method in the Mineplex Purchases SDK module
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Crowns Debited">
    The Mineplex payments service attempts to debit the player Crown balance
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Managed Entitlement Grant">
    The Mineplex payments service automatically grants the player the entitlement associated with the purchase
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Event Received">
    An event is sent back to your game code based on the `callbackDelivery` mode defined in the purchaseable defintion file (see below). You don't need to handle this event if your unlockable content is exclusively a Managed Entitlement, but you must still
    acknowledge the event to prevent it from being automatically refunded.
  </StepItem>
</Step>

## Creating a Managed Entitlement
Right now, the only supported Managed Entitlement type is for priority queuing of players. This means that you can create a product or subscription that, when purchased, grants the player priority access to a game server's queue.

If the player refunds the purchase or cancels the subscription, the priority access is automatically revoked by the Managed Entitlements system.

### Queue Priority Managed Entitlement
To declare a Managed Entitlement for queue priority within a product or subscription, add the following YAML to the definition file:
```yaml
managedEntitlements:
  queuePriority: <number>
```

The `queuePriority` field should be a number that represents the priority level of the player. The higher the number, the higher the priority level and the faster they will receive a match when joining a congested game server.

For more information on how queue prioritization works, see the [Queue Prioritization](/docs/sdk/features/queueing/queue-prioritization) documentation.

A full example of a product definition file with a Managed Entitlement for queue priority is as follows:
```yaml
productId: "priority-queue-10"
productName: "Queue Priority 10"
productDescription: "This allows you to skip the queue and join the game server faster!"
price: 100
callbackDelivery: "ALLOW_OFFLINE_DELIVERY"
repeatablePurchase: false

managedEntitlements:
  queuePriority: 10
```

In this case, players who purchase the "Power Up" product will receive a queue priority of `10` when joining a game server for the project specified in the `game-properties.yaml` file.
