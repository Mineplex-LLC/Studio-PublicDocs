## Configuring Quests
<Note title="Required Implementation">
We expect you to setup quests on your game(s) within 90 days of publishing.
</Note>

The first step to setting up quests is to define them within your project.

Add your quest definitions into your configuration folder, under the quests subfolder, as shown:
<FileTree>
  <Folder name="config" label="config">
    <Folder name="quests" label="quests">
        <File name="first-adventure.yaml" label="first-adventure.yaml" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

Quest definitions should be formatted as follows:

```yaml
# A name displayed to players when picking up the quest
displayName: "First Adventure"

# The objective required to be completed, with a sufficient description
objectiveDescription:
- "Head into the Great Mines and"
- "Defeat 10 Blaze Monsters"

# Any (optional) rewards you'd like to give as extra incentives
studioRewards:
- "100 Bonus Coins"

# How difficult your quest is (EASY/MEDIUM/HARD)
difficulty: "EASY"

# How much time people have to complete your quest (DAILY/WEEKLY)
frequency: "DAILY"
```

## Awarding progress
Once players pick up a quest, they'll want to pop in your game to complete it. This part shows how you can progress a player's quest.
We call an instance of a picked-up quest a "Quest Ticket", as they're trying to complete a picked up ticket (like a bingo ticket).

<Step>
    <StepItem title="Player completes an action">
    Let's say your quest is to kill blazes (like our example configured quest "First Adventure")

    Well, we'll need to listen for the EntityDeathEvent to be informed when this happens!

    ```java
    @EventHandler
    public void playerKillBlaze(final EntityDeathEvent event) {
        // if killed naturally - ignore
        if(event.getDamageSource().getCausingEntity() == null) return; 
        // if the killed entity is not a blaze - ignore
        if(!(event.getEntity() instanceof Blaze)) return;
        // check kill is a player & store the player as a variable
        if(!(event.getDamageSource().getCausingEntity() instanceof Player player)) return;

        // todo - next step!
    }
    ```
    </StepItem>
    <StepItem title="Add progress to the quest">
    Next, we'll always award progress to the player when completing an action in any given quest - as the `addProgressIfAssigned` method checks they're assigned before trying to award. This saves us checking the player is assigned before hitting the method.
    ```java
    // get the quest module from the module manager
    final QuestModule questModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(QuestModule.class);

    // award the quest using the quest's file name (removing the file type suffix) as a quest key.
    // you can use addProgressIfAssigned(player, "first-adventure", 2) to award more than 1.
    questModule.addProgressIfAssigned(player, "first-adventure");
    ```
    </StepItem>
    <StepItem title="Dish out your defined rewards">
    Well, would you look at that, the player has killed our 10 blazes! Once a player completes a quest, `MineplexQuestCompleteEvent` is thrown using the Paper event channel! We should handle this event by giving rewards to the player.
    
    This is only needed if you've added `studioRewards` to your quest's configuration!
    ```java
    @EventHandler
    public void blazeQuestCompleted(final MineplexQuestCompleteEvent event) {
        // check the event has the key we're expecting
        if(!event.getQuestKey().equals("first-adventure")) return;

        // get the player completing the quest
        final Player player = event.getPlayer();

        // give them rewards using your systems
        addCoins(player, 100);
    }
    ```
    </StepItem>
