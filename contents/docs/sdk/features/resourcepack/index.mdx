# Resource Pack Module

The resource pack module allows game developers on the Mineplex Studio to retrieve uploaded resource pack and display those to players.
All resource packs must be stored in the `config/resource-packs` directory and are identified by their file name.

## Uploading Resource Packs
Store all your resource packs in the `config/resource-packs` directory, and they will be uploaded to the Mineplex Studio 
automatically during the github build action or during the start of your development server.

## Updating Resource Packs
To update a resource pack, simply replace the old version with the new version and re-run the github action or re-start the development server. 

## Retrieving Resource Packs
 ```java
 public ResourcePack getResourcePack(final String packName) {
    resourcePackModule.get(packName);
 }
 
 public ImmutableMap<String, ResourcePack> getResourcePacks() {
    return resourcePackModule.getAll();
 }
 ```
