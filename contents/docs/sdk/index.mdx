description: How to get started building a game with the Mineplex Studio SDK.

Once you've created a new project, you can get started building your game on top of the Studio SDK.

## Prerequisites
Before you can get started with the SDK, you'll need to install the [Dependency](/docs/sdk/installation). If you created your project using the Studio CLI, this will be installed by default already. You also need to make sure you have JDK21 installed on your computer.

## Modules
The Studio SDK is comprised of multiple different types of functionality, referred to as "Modules". The SDK comes pre-packaged with several built-in modules we made for you. You can also make your own custom modules to implement your unique gameplay! Soon, we also plan to allow you to make modules to sell to other game developers via our asset marketplace.

## Java Project Setup
When building a game using the Studio SDK, it's important to make sure you're targeting the right version of Minecraft and Java. The Studio currently supports the latest version of Minecraft (1.21.1) and Java 21. Your Studio project will be packaged in the form of a Paper plugin. If you're not familiar with what that is, we encourage you to do some research before getting started.
