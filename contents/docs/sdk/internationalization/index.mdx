title: Internationalization
description: How to internationalize text strings in the Studio.
---

By releasing your game on the Mineplex Studio, you are gaining access to a global audience of players, all excited to
try out what you've built. In order to make sure that all our players have the best possible experience, no matter where
they're from, we've prioritized our internationalization system from the outset. While you are not required to make use
of this system, you are highly encouraged to take advantage of it if you can. Your game's reach and playerbase will grow
from making all players feel welcome!

## Language Selection

Our internationalization system integrates directly with the game client to perform language selection, meaning your
players will automagically experience your game in the language they're already familiar with playing Minecraft in -
assuming you've provided the necessary translations.

## Language Mappings

Language data files should stored as UTF-8 encoded `.properties` files in the `resource` directory of your project
and loaded on application startup through the `I18NModule`.

## API

After loading the translations, you can use the `Component.translatable` method to create a translatable component.

## Examples

## Mappings

Let's say we're internationalizing our application. In our `resource` directory, we need to create a mapping
file, such as `MyMessages_en.properties` for English or `MyMessages_de.properties` for German.

Our english translations inside `MyMessages_en.properties`
 ```properties
my_game.join.greeting=Hello there!
 ```

Our german translations inside `MyMessages_de.properties`
 ```properties
my_game.join.greeting=Hallo!
 ```

Lets load our new translations!

```java
public void loadTranslations() {
    final I18NModule i18NModule = MineplexModuleManager.getRegisteredModule(I18NModule.class);
    for (final Locale locale : i18NModule.getAvailableLocales()) {
        final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyMessages", locale, UTF8ResourceBundleControl.get());
        i18NModule.addTranslation(locale, bundle, true);
    }   
}
```

## API

Now that we have our mapping, we can use it in our game code.

 ```java
private final Component greetingText = Component.translatable("my_game.join.greeting");

@EventHandler
public void onJoin(final PlayerJoinEvent event) {
    player.sendMessage(greetingText);
}
 ```
