The Punishment Reasons System is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for moderating projects efficiently. It includes built-in reasons to address common violations and enables consistent handling of infractions without requiring additional development work.

## Built-In Reasons
The following reasons are pre-configured as part of the system. Each reason is associated with a specific type of punishment, a description, severity level, unique identifier, and duration.

The built-in reasons are located in the following class: `com.mineplex.studio.sdk.modules.moderation.BuiltInReason`

## Creating Custom Reasons

This guide provides two approaches to creating custom reasons for punishments: using the `PunishmentReasonImpl` builder or creating an enum that extends `PunishmentReason`.

### Which Option to Choose?
- Option 1: Use if you need to dynamically create reasons at runtime.
- Option 2: Use if you have a fixed set of reasons and want to avoid duplication.

### Option 1: Creating instance of PunishmentReasonImpl
To create a custom punishment reason with `PunishmentReasonImpl`, use its builder pattern. This allows you to define specific details such as type, display reason, priority, identifier, and duration.

```java
final PunishmentReasonImpl banReason = PunishmentReasonImpl.builder()
    .type(PunishmentType.TEMP_BAN)
    .displayReason("Excessive Toxicity")
    .priority(1)
    .reasonIdentifier("toxicity")
    .duration(Duration.ofSeconds(3600 * 24));
```

### Option 2: Enum that extends PunishmentReason
For a more structured approach, define an enum that implements the PunishmentReason interface. This is useful when you need a predefined, reusable set of custom reasons.

```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Getter
public enum CustomReason implements PunishmentReason {
    MY_REASON(PunishmentType.TEMP_BAN, "My custom reason", 1, "custom_reason", Duration.ofHours(24));

    /**
     * The {@link PunishmentType} associated with this reason.
     */
    private final @NonNull PunishmentType type;

    /**
     * A user-friendly display string for this reason.
     */
    private final @NonNull String displayReason;

    /**
     * The priority level of this reason, which may be used to determine the severity or importance.
     */
    private final int priority;

    /**
     * A unique identifier for this reason (unique within your namespace).
     */
    private final @NonNull String reasonIdentifier;

    /**
     * The duration for which the punishment should last.
     * A duration of {@link Duration#ZERO} indicates a permanent punishment.
     */
    private final @NonNull Duration duration;
}
```
