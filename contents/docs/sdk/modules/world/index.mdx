The World Module is one of the built-in Studio Modules that allows you to create, load, save, and generate worlds dynamically in your project. With the World Module, you can do anything from per-player stored plot worlds, to massive persistent generated adventure worlds, to ephemeral worlds created from map templates. `MineplexWorld`s are totally configurable, from their persistence, to their generation, to whether they exist only in memory. They also contain keyed Data Points that can be used to dynamically load points of interest from varied map templates - the days of hard coding specific locations in your game are long gone.

## Creating a `MineplexWorld`
 In order to create a new `MineplexWorld`, the World Module method `createMineplexWorld(MineplexWorldConfig)` must be executed with a completed and valid `MineplexWorldConfig`.

### `MineplexWorldConfig`
 A `MineplexWorldConfig` is comprised of a few key options.
 
 First, you have the option to specify a `PersistentWorldConfig`. By default, this is `null`, indicating that the `MineplexWorld` will not be persistent. Setting this value to a valid `PersistentWorldConfig` will cause the created `MineplexWorld` to be persistent.

#### `PersistentWorldConfig`
 The only configuration needed in a `PersistentWorldConfig` is a `String` value for the `worldBucket` option. This value will determine the name of the data collection this persistent world will be stored within.

 Next comes the significant portion of the configuration process for a new `MineplexWorld`. The `WorldCreationConfig` comprises almost all of the options that control the makeup of the new world. This config cannot be `null`, and must be filled out by you so as to be valid.

#### `WorldCreationConfig`
 Within the `WorldCreationConfig` there are several configuration options, some of which conflict with each other. The first option is a `String` value for the `worldTemplate`, which defaults to `null`. If this is set to a value, any further options in the `WorldCreationConfig` will be ignored and the `MineplexWorld` will be initialized from the project map template named the same as the `String` value, if the template exists. If there is no such named template, then the world creation will fail. The next option is `voidWorld`, which can be `true` or `false`. This option defaults to `true`, in which case the created world will generate no terrain, and therefore all subsequent options in the `WorldCreationConfig` will be ignored. If this option is set to `false`, then the world will generate via the default generator, or a custom one if specified. A custom world generator can be defined for the new world via the following options:
 - `customChunkGenerator` will accept a `ChunkGenerator` implementation from the Bukkit API. You should conduct further research on how this API section works before attempting it in your project. Defaults to `null`.
 - `customBlockPopulators` will accept a `Collection<BlockPopulator>`, based on `BlockPopulator` implementations from the Bukkit API. This can be directly specified, or included in the above `customChunkGenerator` if one is set. You should conduct further research on how this API section works before attempting it in your project. Defaults to `null`.
 - `customBiomeProvider` will accept a `BiomeProvider` implementation from the Bukkit API. This can be directly specified, or included in the above `customChunkGenerator` if one is set. You should conduct further research on how this API section works before attempting it in your project. Defaults to `null`.

 Finally, the seed for the world generation can be specified by setting the `customSeed` option to a given `Long` value. Defaults to `null`, in which case a random seed is used.

 After the `WorldCreationConfig` is complete, you need to make a determination as to what region format your new `MineplexWorld` should use, by setting the `worldRegionType` option to one of the `WorldRegionFormatType`s. Defaults to `WorldRegionFormatType.ANVIL`.

#### `WorldRegionFormatType`
- `ANVIL`: The Minecraft Java Edition standard region format developed by Mojang. Regions are stored as `.mca` files.

 Finally, you must specify whether your `MineplexWorld` should exist exclusively in memory via the `inMemoryOnly` option, or if it should instead utilize the storage of the container to load/unload chunks. By default this is set to `true`, in memory only, and this should work for most use cases. However, **if your map template is significantly large, or if players are able to cause the world to generate without a sufficiently tight boundary, the world may grow to a size that cannot be retained in memory. If this is the case, electing to keep the `inMemoryOnly` option set to `true` may result in undefined behavior or container crashes.**

## Loading a `MineplexWorld` from Storage
 There are two ways to load a persistent `MineplexWorld` from long-term storage. Your first option is the World Module method `loadMineplexWorld(String, String, WorldCreationConfig)`, which attempts to asynchronously download and load in the `MineplexWorld` with the specified ID from the specified `worldBucket`. If no `MineplexWorld` matches the ID in that `worldBucket`, then no `MineplexWorld` is loaded. Alternatively, you can use the World Module method `loadOrCreateMineplexWorld(String, String, MineplexWorldConfig)`, which also attempts to asynchronously download and load in the `MineplexWorld` with the specified ID from the specified `worldBucket`. However, in the case where this method does not find a matching `MineplexWorld`, it will create a new one using the provided `MineplexWorldConfig`.

## Unloading a `MineplexWorld`
 You are not able to force a `MineplexWorld` to unload, however you should not need to. Instead, you can use the World Module method `releaseWorld(MineplexWorld)` to indicate to the World Module that the world is no longer needed. At that point, the World Module will conduct save procedures for the `MineplexWorld` (if any are defined), then unload the world and free up any space.

## Deleting a `MineplexWorld`
 This functionality is specifically for unloaded persistent `MineplexWorld`s. **This should not be called for a loaded or ephemeral world.** To delete a stored persistent `MineplexWorld`, call the World Module method `deleteWorld(String, String)` with the `MineplexWorld` `worldBucket` and ID as the argument.

## Getting a loaded `MineplexWorld`
 In order to get a `MineplexWorld` that has already been loaded by the World Module, use the method `getLoadedMineplexWorld(String)`. **Note that this will require you to know the `MineplexWorld` ID.**

# Examples

## Creating a `MineplexWorld` from a Map Template
 Let's say we have some map templates in our project. We can dynamically create new `MineplexWorld`s based on those templates at runtime.
 ```java
 public MineplexWorld createFromTemplate(final String template) {
     // Creates a new in-memory, ephemeral world from the given template using the ANVIL region format
     return worldModule.createMineplexWorld(MineplexWorldConfig.builder()
             .worldRegionType(MineplexWorldConfig.WorldRegionFormatType.ANVIL)
             .worldCreationConfig(WorldCreationConfig.builder()
                     .worldTemplate(template)
                     .build())
             .build());
 }
 ```

## Randomly Generating a `MineplexWorld`
 Let's say we don't want to use a template. We can create a new `MineplexWorld` using the random world generation built into the game. We can also make it persistent.
 ```java
 public MineplexWorld generateNewPersistentWorld(final Long seed) {
     // Creates and generates a new persistent world cached on the filesystem
     // using the anvil region format and a seed
     return worldModule.createMineplexWorld(MineplexWorldConfig.builder()
             .persistentWorldConfig(PersistentWorldConfig.builder()
                     .worldBucket("Examples")
                     .build())
             .worldCreationConfig(WorldCreationConfig.builder()
                     .voidWorld(false)
                     .customSeed(seed)
                     .build())
             .build());
 }
 ```
