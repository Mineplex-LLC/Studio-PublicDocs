 The Mineplex Studio comes packaged with several third party developer resources that make it easier than ever before to make a fantastic game in Minecraft. We are constantly evaluating the developer landscape and adding new resources to this list, so don't forget to check back here often!

## Paper
 [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper) is a Minecraft game server based on Spigot, designed to greatly improve performance and offer more advanced features and API. This includes the [Adventure User Interface API](https://docs.advntr.dev/index.html), and the [md_5 BungeeCord chat API](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/the-chat-component-api/).

## FloodGate
 [FloodGate](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/) is a Geyser addition allowing you to distinguish between Java Edition and Bedrock Edition players and to send Bedrock Edition players [Cumulus Forms](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/forms/).

## InvUI
 [InvUI](https://github.com/NichtStudioCode/InvUI) is a powerful library allowing you to efficiently and easily create and manage complex and detailed inventory-based GUIs for players to interact with in your projects.

## HolographicDisplays
 [HolographicDisplays](https://github.com/filoghost/HolographicDisplays) is a library allowing you to display text and items to players using futuristic in-game Holograms. This API can be accessed using the `HologramUtil` in the Studio SDK.

## ProtocolLib
 [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) is a library that allows read and write access to the [Minecraft protocol](https://wiki.vg/Protocol). It handles most of the overhead required with reflection and channel injection and provides wrappers to simplify packet modification.

## LibsDisguises
 [Lib's Disguises](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/) is a library that lets you disguise any entity, as any entity. You can fully customize all these disguises, and even apply special effects to disguises. Examples include creating a player disguise called "Notch", but he's always sneaking, or disguising every creeper as a friendly villager. Part of the Lib's Disguises functionality is the ability to let players see their own disguises.

## MythicMobs
 [MythicMobs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/⚔-mythicmobs-free-version-►the-1-custom-mob-creator◄.5702/) allows you to fully modify all attributes of monsters in your project, and even create your own mobs, bosses, and other many other fun mob-related things.

## ModelEngine
 [Model Engine](https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?resources/model-engine—ultimate-entity-model-manager-1-16-5-1-20.389/) allows you to effortlessly create seemingly modded models for mobs in your project, without touching any configs.

## Ignite
 [Ignite](https://github.com/vectrix-space/ignite) expands the limits of what you can do with just Paper, granting you access to Mixins and Access Wideners within the Paper ecosystem so that you have the option to directly modify the server to make the game of your dreams.
